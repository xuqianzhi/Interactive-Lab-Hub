# Part 2:
# Description
In part1, many test users find it is very unintuitive to get a sense of the current time by looking at the number of times a song is played since midnight. Therefore, in part 2, my design focuses on making the design more intuitive. My design for part 2 divides a day into morning, afternoon, evening and night, and it allows users to choose distinct songs for each period. Then, my device will suggest user their favorite music based on different time of the day. For example, user may find it relaxing to listen to piano musics in the morning, but prefer some rock music for the afternoon, and my device will suggest piano music in the morning, and rock music in the afternoon.
