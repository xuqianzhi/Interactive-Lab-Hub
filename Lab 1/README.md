# Staging Interaction


## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**
Setting: interaction happens at elevator, especially elevator of less crowded building where people would tend to assume that no one is behind the elevator door
Players: it involves people who are using the elevator (inside a running elevator), and people who are waiting for the elevator.
Activity: players who are waiting for the elevator can understand if anyone is currently inside the elevator from the indicator light
Goals: at a non-crowded building, the chance of empty elevator is high, therefore habitually, people at such building tend to assume there is no one in the elevator upon door opening. The goal of this design is to avoid any potential collision by alerting people in advance. 

**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

**Summarize feedback you got here.**
It will be difficult to implement for existing elevators because adding additional indicator light and sensors can be expensive and impractical. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
For existing elevator, it is difficult to find a proper way to place the indicator light because the light is not built-in for the elevator

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
Instead of using sensor to “sense” the presence of people inside the elevator (e.g. ultrasonic or infra-red), we can utilize attributes that are corollary of presence of people (e.g. elevator weight, floor button pressed etc.)

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
Works like a charm!

## Part D. Wizard the device
For this particular idea, it is quite hard to get Wi-Fi source in the elevator, so I chose to manually change screen color without using remote control

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
How to integrate the device with elevators

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

Co-actor: Tice (not in the class) 



# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*
1. The light indicator designed in part 1 is too simple and can be potentially confusing. This can be improved by:

    * give the light a "man" icon so that it is more obvious what the light is indicating

    * if someone is present in the elevator, there should be 2 different scenarios: scenario 1, if the button corresponding to the current floor is pressed, this should indicate that someone will get out of the elevator; otherwise, scenario 2, someone is present, but no one will get out

    * following the point above, in scenario 1, the light should be orange and blinking, and the buzzer should play an alert sound; in scenario 2, the light should be orange and not blinking, and no sound should be played

2. The video should make it clearer how the elevator detects the presence of people inside

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*

Improved Storyboard: (original storyboard pictures are in the image folder)
