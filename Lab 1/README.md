# Staging Interaction


## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**
Setting: interaction happens at elevator, especially elevator of less crowded building where people would tend to assume that no one is behind the elevator door
Players: it involves people who are using the elevator (inside a running elevator), and people who are waiting for the elevator.
Activity: players who are waiting for the elevator can understand if anyone is currently inside the elevator from the indicator light
Goals: at a non-crowded building, the chance of empty elevator is high, therefore habitually, people at such building tend to assume there is no one in the elevator upon door opening. The goal of this design is to avoid any potential collision by alerting people in advance. 

**Include a picture of your storyboard here**

**Summarize feedback you got here.**
It will be difficult to implement for existing elevators because adding additional indicator light and sensors can be expensive and impractical. 

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
For existing elevator, it is difficult to find a proper way to place the indicator light because the light is not built-in for the elevator

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
Instead of using sensor to “sense” the presence of people inside the elevator (e.g. ultrasonic or infra-red), we can utilize attributes that are corollary of presence of people (e.g. elevator weight, floor button pressed etc.)

## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
Works like a charm!

## Part D. Wizard the device
For this particular idea, it is quite hard to get Wi-Fi source in the elevator, so I chose to manually change screen color without using remote control

## Part E. Costume the device

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*
How to integrate the device with elevators

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*
